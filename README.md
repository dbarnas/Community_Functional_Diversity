# Community Functional Diversity

This repository is for a master's thesis project at California State University, Northridge.  Data are collected in Mo'orea, French Polynesia along the western shore fringing coral reef.  This repository holds data, scripts, and output for community composition surveys of two coral reefs.  Community is analyzed for functional trait diversity of coral reefs impacted by submarine groundwater discharge.
